![banner](https://www.plu.edu/computer-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/551/2020/03/datascience-1024x396-1.jpg)

📖 This repository is dedicated to studying two courses from MIT OCW:
- **RES.6-012 | Spring 2018 | Undergraduate**: [Introduction to Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/pages/part-i-the-fundamentals/)
- **18.650 | Fall 2016 | Undergraduate**: [Fundamentals of Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/)

🎯 The primary goal of this repo is to cover probability and statistics topics in-depth, focusing on thoroughly understanding the theory first. Practical, hands-on applications will be added as a complement, but only when necessary to reinforce the theoretical concepts.

👩🏻‍💻 Most of the notes, exercises, and examples here are created using Markdown files for explanations and Jupyter Notebooks for practical exercises or applications.
