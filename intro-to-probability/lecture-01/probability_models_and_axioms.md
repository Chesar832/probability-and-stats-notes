3. **Discrete Probability Example**  
   Calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7 when rolling two six-sided dice.

4. **Continuous Probability Example**  
   Define a continuous sample space for a point chosen uniformly at random in a square with side length 1.

5. **Set Operations in Probability**  
   If $A$ and $B$ are two events such that $P(A) = 0.3$, $P(B) = 0.4$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0.1$, find $P(A \cup B)$.

6. **Countable Additivity**  
   Describe the countable additivity property and provide a simple example where it applies.

7. **Complement Rule**  
   If $P(A) = 0.6$, calculate $P(A^c)$.

8. **Mutual Exclusivity**  
   Explain what it means for two events to be mutually exclusive and provide an example.

9. **Law of Total Probability**  
   State and explain the law of total probability using an example.

10. **Interpretations of Probability**  
    Discuss the difference between the frequentist and Bayesian interpretations of probability.

## Practical Exercises

1. **Calculating Probabilities**  
   A bag contains 3 red, 2 blue, and 5 green balls. What is the probability of picking a red or a green ball?

2. **Dice Rolls**  
   Roll a six-sided die twice. What is the probability of rolling a 4 on the first roll and an even number on the second roll?

3. **Card Probability**  
   What is the probability of drawing an Ace or a King from a standard 52-card deck?

4. **Uniform Distribution**  
   A random variable $X$ is uniformly distributed over $[0, 1]$. What is the probability that $X < 0.25$?

5. **Coin Tosses**  
   Toss a fair coin three times. What is the probability of getting exactly two heads?

6. **Conditional Probability**  
   Given that a six-sided die roll resulted in an even number, what is the probability it was a 4?

7. **Intersection of Events**  
   A jar contains 4 red and 6 blue balls. Two balls are picked randomly without replacement. What is the probability that both are red?

8. **Expected Outcomes**  
   Roll a tetrahedral die twice. What is the probability that the sum of the two rolls is at most 5?

9. **Probability Distribution**  
   For a discrete random variable with outcomes $x = `\{1, 2, 3\}`$ and probabilities $P(1) = 0.2$, $P(2) = 0.5$, $P(3) = 0.3$, verify that it satisfies the axioms of probability.

10. **Real-Life Scenario**  
    The probability of rain tomorrow is $0.7$. What is the probability it will not rain?
